# 🏠 Smart Home System

A simulation of a smart home system showcasing object-oriented programming principles like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and interface implementation in C#. The project features smart devices with unique behaviors and shared functionalities.

---

## 🧩 **Features**

- **Abstract Class**: `SmartDevice` provides a base for all devices with common methods like `TurnOn` and `TurnOff`.
- **Interface**: `IAdjustable` defines adjustable settings for devices like volume or brightness.
- **Device Types**:
  - **💡 Light**: Basic smart light functionality.
  - **❄️ AirConditioner**: Adjustable cooling level.
  - **🔊 SmartSpeaker**: Adjustable volume control.
- **Polymorphism**: Manage all devices in a unified list and interact with shared methods.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Safely check and adjust settings for devices implementing `IAdjustable`.

## 💡 **How It Works**

1. **Devices**: Devices are created and added to a list.
2. **Looping**: The program loops through the list, calling shared and specific behaviors for each device.
3. **Adjustments**: Adjustable devices (like **AirConditioner** and **SmartSpeaker**) demonstrate dynamic adjustments.
